# Custom Slash Commands

Custom slash commands allow you to create custom commands that users can trigger from the message input box. When a user types your custom command, Mattermost sends an HTTP POST/GET request to your specified endpoint, which can then respond with messages and actions.

## Creating a Custom Slash Command

1. Go to **Product menu > Integrations > Slash Commands**
2. Click **Add Slash Command** and configure:
   - Title and Description
   - Command Trigger Word (must be unique, no spaces)
   - Request URL (endpoint that receives the command)
   - Request Method (POST or GET)
   - Optional: Response Username and Icon
   - Optional: Autocomplete settings

## Request Format

When a slash command is triggered, Mattermost sends a request to your endpoint with these parameters:

- channel_id: ID of the channel where command was executed
- channel_name: Name of the channel
- command: The slash command that was executed
- team_domain: Team domain
- team_id: Team ID
- text: Any additional text after the command
- token: The verification token
- user_id: ID of the user who triggered the command
- user_name: Username of the user

## Response Format

Your endpoint can respond with a JSON payload containing:

- text: Markdown-formatted message text
- response_type: "ephemeral" (only visible to triggering user) or "in_channel" (visible to all)
- attachments: Optional message attachments for rich formatting
- props: Optional custom properties
- username: Optional override of the bot's username
- icon_url: Optional override of the bot's icon

Example response:
{
    "response_type": "in_channel",
    "text": "Command response message",
    "attachments": [{
        "title": "Optional attachment",
        "text": "Additional formatting"
    }]
}

## Security Considerations

- Verify the token in the request matches your slash command token
- Use HTTPS for your endpoint URL
- Keep your endpoint URL and tokens secret
